Compiler Construction
=====================

This projects requires us to make a python compiler. We are currently very excited about developing this. The compiler is going to be built in various stages.

To know more about this project please visit the [course page](http://www.cs.colorado.edu/~bec/courses/csci4555-s15/index.html).

Please read the class [notes](notes.pdf) for the intricate details about what we are doing.

Basic Examples
==============
The directory [basic_programs](basic_programs) contains examples on how to use the python [compiler](https://docs.python.org/2/library/compiler.html) library to parse python input statements and get Abstract Syntax Trees(ASTs). It also contains other utility functions.

Stages
======
Stage 1 Coverage:
* print statements
* input() statements
* print statements
* unary minus (-)
* binary plus

Stage 2 (Current Stage):
* We make a parser in python that works for the language subset from stage 1.
